Two wolves killing inside of me. Bloody bleeding hearts and it is so fucked up.</b></em> because on one hand I would like to talk about being sick but on the other hand I don't really feel very comfortable doing that here.<br>It's like when you post something online, everyone who sees it takes a piece of it. I don't like the idea of strangers taking bits of me. I don't trust strangers.</p><p>Either way, I'm sick and it makes me really tired and I can't do much and it feels bad and I guess that's all I'll say. Except that the cold weather makes it worse also.<br>Despite all that, I'm glad autumn is here. I like the way it looks outside plus it means my cat isn't too hot to cuddle under the duvet anymore :)</p><hr><figure style=\"max-width:399px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\"><figcaption><span style=\"color:#778899; text-align:center; \">SOMEWHAT RELATED SCHEMATIC:</span></figcaption><img loading=\"lazy\"class=\"modalImg\" style=\"width:100%; max-width:399px;\" src=\"/images/journal/coldweather.png\"></figure>",

      "content_html": "<p>I went to a music and arts festival recently and there was a lot of crazy art and confident art-types everywhere. It really inspired me but it's also made me feel very... inferior?<br>I love making webpages, I love making pixelart and 3d models, but it feels second-rate to the kind of things I saw at the festival like ... tangible, cutting-edge art. And that's not me saying I think x art is more \"Art\"than y art because thats <i>stupid</i>. Just that the art I do make doesn't make me feel like an artist.</p>\r\n<p>I grew up drawing and painting. That was like THE thing I did. It was ALL I did. I lost touch with that when I became a Grown Up and idk why exactly but I think the growing pressure and idea of \"your art is only worth something if you show people/post it online:)\"definitely didn't help.<br>And even now that I'm inspired to start painting again, in the back of my head I keep just thinking \"but will it get popular on instagram?\"&nbsp;<br>I hhhhhhaaaaaattttteeeeee that shit, man</p>",

I've wanted my links page to act like one since I started this site ages ago, bc I want it to be like you're using the laptop on the dog-house homepage. The most nostalgic OS to me is Windows Vista (what was on my first laptop) so I made it with that vibe in mind.<br>I've been learning more recently about styling things with pure CSS using stuff like svg filters and background blend modes, so the taskbar styling is entirely in the CSS. It was fun but it does really open the door to it looking really bad on other people's machines/browsers.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"class=\"modalImg\"src=\"/images/misc/dhpc.png\"style=\"width:100%;\"><figcaption><span style=\"color:#bd3212;\">This is now my actual desktop background for my XP-Pen which is small enough for the bad resolution of this image to not be noticeable:) lol</span></figcaption></figure><p>The cloud image is actually a background from windows 95, just with the levels adjusted so the image is more saturated and \u2026 blue. The dogPC graphic is an SVG loaded into blender and given a glass material.

One of the first things I planted was a foxglove in my mum’s garden, and when it produced seeds I collected them and used them to grow my first plants from seed. Foxgloves are biennials which means they grow their leaves for a year, then flower the next year before seeding and dying.</p><p>I planted those seeds 2 years ago in little trays and this is them now!!!<br><table><tr><td><img loading=\"lazy\"class=\"modalImg\"src=\"/images/journal/photos/foxgloves2-min.jpg\"alt=\"three pink foxgloves and one white foxglove in a garden\"></td><td><img loading=\"lazy\"class=\"modalImg\"src=\"/images/journal/photos/foxgloves1-min.jpg\"alt=\"a foxglove with pink and white flowers\"></td><td><video autoplay loop muted playsinline class=\"modalImg\"src=\"/images/journal/photos/foxgloves.webm\"></video> </td></tr></table><br>They’re around 2 metres tall and still growing. Ones I’ve gotten from garden centres before have been smaller and with much fewer flower spikes so I am very proud. They like where I’ve put them a lot.<hr><p>A poem about foxgloves that I am writing right now:<blockquote><em>Congregation buzzes,<br>Busy bodies in and out<br>to clean high hanging bells,<br>Pink cathedral with your tall spires,<br> How do I get in?</em></blockquote></p>",
